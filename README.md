# Autologin IITK :: CIPH3R

## Introduction

`autologin-iitk` is a Python script designed to automate the login process for IIT Kanpur's firewall authentication page. This script continuously checks for the firewall authentication portal, performs login, and keeps the session alive to maintain internet connectivity without manual intervention.

## Motive

- Servers and most of the computers in labs are connected via LAN and require login to the firewall authentication page at every boot. To automate this process, this script was made.

- We might need to connect exclusively to the '**iitk**' WiFi SSID in some cases, which again requires logging in to the firewall authentication page. Hence, `autologin-iitk`.

# Installation

### Pre Requisites:

- (Python 3) - If executing the following command in terminal ouputs python version; then you are good to go:

    - Windows

        ```
    - Linux & Mac

        ```sh

# Additional Info

- The script is designed to self-terminate after 3 Hrs in the case of failures or when you are already connected to internet way beyond refresh time.

- There is a possibility of a maximum downtime of 15 minutes in case reboots are involved, as it doesn't store the last authentication time. 

- In such cases, you can simply restart the service with the below command (former). And for checking logs, you can use the below command (latter):

  - **Windows** (In powershell): 
  
    - For restarting (powershell must be runas **Administrator**), execute below command (or) you can do it from `services.msc`: 

        ```powershell
        Restart-Service -Name "autologin-iitk" -Force
        ```

    - For logs, execute:

        ```powershell
        Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\autologin-iitk\autologin-iitk.log
        ```

  - **Linux** (In bash shell):
